OpenAI HTTP Server
The OpenAI HTTP Server is a Python application that creates a basic web interface for generating text completions using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 engine (davinci). This interface allows you to enter a text prompt and receive a generated text completion response from the OpenAI API.

Prerequisites
Before running the OpenAI HTTP Server, make sure you have the following:
Python 3.6 or higher installed.
The required Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:
pip install requests

Configuration
In order to use the OpenAI HTTP Server, you need to provide your OpenAI API key.

Replace the OPENAI_API_KEY variable in the server.py file with your actual OpenAI API key.

Adjust the max_tokens parameter in the do_POST method to control the length of the generated text.

Usage
Start the HTTP server by running the following command in your terminal:
python server.py
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

You will be presented with a simple web form where you can enter your text prompt.

After submitting the prompt, the server will send a request to the OpenAI API and display the generated text completion as the response on the web page.

Example Usage
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

Enter your text prompt in the provided input field, such as: "Once upon a time..."

Click the "Submit" button.

The server will send a request to the OpenAI API and display the generated text completion on the web page.

Important Notes
This application is a basic example for interacting with the OpenAI API through a simple web interface. You may need to customize and enhance it based on your specific requirements and use cases.

Make sure to follow the terms of use and guidelines provided by OpenAI when using their API.
