OpenAI SOAP Server
The OpenAI SOAP Server is a Python application that utilizes the Spyne library to create a SOAP-based API for generating text completions using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 engine (davinci). This server allows you to send a text prompt and receive a generated text completion response from the OpenAI API.

Prerequisites
Before running the OpenAI SOAP Server, make sure you have the following:
Python 3.6 or higher installed.
The required Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:
pip install spyne requests

Configuration
In order to use the OpenAI SOAP Server, you need to provide your OpenAI API key and configure the desired parameters for text generation.

Replace the OPENAI_API_KEY variable in the server.py file with your actual OpenAI API key.

Adjust the max_tokens parameter in the generate_response method to control the length of the generated text.

Usage
Start the SOAP server by running the following command in your terminal:
python server.py

Once the server is running, you can send a SOAP request to the server endpoint using any SOAP client. The server endpoint is http://localhost:8000.

The SOAP request should include a prompt parameter, which is the text prompt you want to use for generating the text completion.

The server will respond with the generated text completion based on the provided prompt.

Example SOAP Request
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:web="http://spyne.io/complex/soap/web/tutorial">
    <soapenv:Header/>
    <soapenv:Body>
        <web:generate_response>
            <web:prompt>Once upon a time</web:prompt>
        </web:generate_response>
    </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

Example SOAP Response
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:web="http://spyne.io/complex/soap/web/tutorial">
    <soapenv:Header/>
    <soapenv:Body>
        <web:generate_responseResponse>
            <web:return>...generated text completion...</web:return>
        </web:generate_responseResponse>
    </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
Important Notes
This application is a basic example for integrating the OpenAI API with a SOAP server. You may need to customize and enhance it based on your specific requirements and use cases.

Make sure to follow the terms of use and guidelines provided by OpenAI when using their API.
