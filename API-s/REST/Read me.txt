Flask OpenAI API
This project demonstrates a simple Flask-based RESTful API that interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3 engine to generate text responses based on user prompts.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the Flask API on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
requests library (install using pip install requests)
OpenAI API key (sign up at OpenAI if you don't have one)


Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-openai-api.git
cd flask-openai-api

Install the required dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
Replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY in app.py with your actual OpenAI API key.
Run the Flask application.
python app.py
The API server will start at http://localhost:8000.

Send a POST request to the /generate_response endpoint with a JSON payload containing a prompt field to get a response from the OpenAI GPT-3 engine. For example:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Once upon a time"}' http://localhost:8000/generate_response

API Endpoint
POST /generate_response
Generate a text response based on the provided prompt.

Request:

json
Copy code
{
  "prompt": "Your prompt here."
}
Response (200 OK):

json
Copy code
{
  "response": "Generated response from OpenAI."
}
Response (500 Internal Server Error):

json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Unable to extract valid response from OpenAI"
}


Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
Thanks to Flask and the requests library for providing the foundation for building this API.
